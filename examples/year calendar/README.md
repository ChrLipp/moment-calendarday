This year calendar is an example for 
[moment-calendarday](https://github.com/ChrLipp/moment-calendarday).

[moment-calendarday](https://github.com/ChrLipp/moment-calendarday) is a
Typescript Calendar class implemented as a [moment.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)
plugin which allows to config and access calendar day information.

For the HTML structure I wrote a Groovy [generator](https://gist.github.com/ChrLipp/6125be86571f08a5994a).
