== What is it?
A calendar class written in Typescript which delivers 2 well tested classes:

- CalendarHelper, which just provide some basic calendar operations
- CalendarDayEntries, which defines initialisation and storage for calendar days

A calendar day is described with the class CalenderDayEntry. Currently it has just tow properties:

- name, the name of the day
- isFeastDay, a boolean property which defines if the day is a feast day

The initialisation of a calendar year is done with a JSON structure, defined in ConfigDays.
The advantage of the given implementation is that the config is year independent, so there is no
need to adapt the config every year.

For some config examples have a look at the unit tests `test/*ConfigSpec.ts

*This project is no longer maintained. A new implementation which provides a
http://momentjs.com/[moment.js]â€š implementation is currently developed.*
